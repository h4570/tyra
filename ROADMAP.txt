------------ Tyra's v2.0 roadmap to publish on GitHub ------------

--- H4570
- [DynPip] TD VU1 program
- [DynPip] Info about: simple clip
- [StaPip] Remove animation
- [StaPip] Dbufferring during mesh unrolling
- [StaPip] VU1 packets spamming
- [McPip] VU1 packets spamming
- [StaPip] Info about: full plane clip
- [Renderer] Github: Allocate dynamic pipeline memory only in "onUse" (core,qbuffrenderer,pipeline..)
- [Game] Update intellisense from docker
- [Renderer] Add possibility to on/off frustum check in all pipelines (renderOptions?)
- [Loaders] Think about ".tyrobj" format - implement it (add multicolor support)
- [Loaders] DFF loader as static Mesh loader
- [Texture] Test cache hits with large amount of textures (dolphin sample?)
- [Demo] Create cool demo which will show all features of Tyra (I will take this one)

--- Wellinator
- [General] Physics and stuff from threeJS

--- Unassigned

- [General] Control generated id to avoid duplication. Maybe Just increment from 0? Add interface IIdentificable?

- [General] rsync is excluding folder like "objects" lol XD

- [DMA] Check if all chain transfers have end tag!

- [General] Change libs of sample? (remove -lpng, -lz...), probably they are not required

- [General] Check if there are any TODOs

- [General] Check all TYRA_ASSERT() if there are no asserts like (TYRA_ASSERT(!audsrv_load_adpcm(result, data, adpcmFileSize)))
because this lines will be removed on make-release. Only debug stuff should be checked in assert

- [General] All Copyrights to 2020-2022

- [General] CI in Github via docker image

- [General] Add cpp lint checker in GitHub

- [Tutorials] 1. Hello world! - explain init(), loop() and what should be inside them (every tutorial should be well commented!)

- [Tutorials] 2. 2D - explain beginFrame(), endFrame()

- [Tutorials] 3. Minecraft cube - explain this pipeline, and explain that there are many 3D pipelines

- [Tutorials] 4. Mesh rendering - explain staticPipeline, render .tyrobj file via Mesh class, explain that this is high-level 
abstract 3D object class, and what it have (animation etc)

- [Tutorials] 5. Manual rendering via staticPipeline - via Render3DBag (core.render()), render simple poly,
explain that this is lower-level abstract rendering, it have the all the features as Mesh rendering, 
because Mesh rendering uses only core.render()

- [Tutorials] 6. Animation in Mesh rendering rendering, explain the API

- [Tutorials] 7. Directional lights in Mesh rendering

- [Tutorials] 8. Color-per-vertex light map in Mesh rendering (color array)

- [Tutorials] 9. Render skybox, and show that stdPipOptions.noClipChecks must be set to false, to turn on clip algorithms (prevent glitches)

------------ Github issues for Tyra v2 ------------
