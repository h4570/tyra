### Description
Tyra is a project that aims to facilitate the development of PlayStation 2 games. The goal is simple API which will allow you to develop some nice small homebrew games in a short period of time. Finally, (thanks to PS2DEV team) Tyra supports C++20, so we are free from the 2003's GCC which only supported C++98.  
**Project is on alpha stage, so keep in mind that there are many things to be done and to fix.**
Unfortunately there are not many people, which want's to help with this project. **If you want to be a volunteer**, but don't have too much knowledge in this field, write to me on Discord, **I will be happy to help.**
 
When project will be on beta stage, we plan to create some YouTube tutorials :)  
  
**Why was this project created?** 
PS2 development can be a big challenge.  
PS2 it's pretty low-level and there are a lot of stuff that you must do from scratch.  
For example, if you want to render something using only PS2DEV you must:
- Create VU1 micro-program
- Load micro-program and send it to VU1
- Create parser for your 3D file
- Create parser for texture file
- Calculate lights, shadows, MVP matrices (3D->2D)..
- Clip triangles ([sic!](https://github.com/h4570/tyra/issues/14))
- Prepare DMA packets for coprocessors communication
- Setup rasterizer (GS)
- Send texture to GS
- Send packets
- Synchronize all  

but with Tyra you can do it with methods like `loadObj()` and `draw()` üòÅ. 

### Features
* 3D support - VU1 "Path 1 rendering"  
* 2D support - PNG & BMP
* Frustum culling, backface culling  
* OpenGL adaptions: Perspective projection, lookAt camera  
* Texture support - .bmp and png  
* Mesh loaders: ".obj", ".dff" (RenderWare, GTA:SA) and ".md2" (Quake II) 
* Threading support 
* Animation support for obj and md2
* Audio support - .wav and .adpcm 
* Pad support 

### Branches
* Master - monthly releases - tested on PS2 & PCSX2.
* Develop - daily builds - can be unstable.

<br />

## Getting Started  

### Installation 
Step by step [tutorial here](https://github.com/h4570/tyra/tree/develop/docs)  
If you need any support, feel free to ask questions on discord:  
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-Tyra-brightgreen?logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/NhhTmg3Gm5)  

### Prerequisites 

* PS2 DEV environment - [PS2DEV](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev)  
* At least #58ffb33 PS2SDK (28.05.2021) - [PS2SDK](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk) 
* PS2 Emulator. For example [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/) 

<br />

## Extra info 
* If you want to use your own .obj file, please check "triangulate faces" in blender.  
PS2 is supporting only triangle primitive type.  

<br />

## Roadmap  

### Roadmap for next master release:  
[Next release roadmap](https://github.com/h4570/tyra/projects/4)  

See the [open issues](https://github.com/h4570/tyra/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Built With  

* [PS2DEV](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev)  

<br />

## Acronyms 
* EE (Emotion Engine) - whole set of processors and subsystems that make up the PlayStation 2 
* GS (Graphic synthesizer) - configurable rasterizer and texture mapper. Has only 2MB~ memory for textures, but for the opposite have very high transfer rate, so you can switch textures in the blink 
* VU0 - programmable (ASM) vector processor that is accessed by inline assembly code injected into C program.  
* VU1 - programmable (ASM) vector processor, which is similar to vertex shader. Accessed via DMA.  
* IOP - I/O processor which enables access to peripheral devices, such the game controller  

<br />

## Thanks  

Without these guys, everything would be harder:
* Dr Henry Fortuna - for code sources
* Rick Gaiser, fjtrujy - for help and new GCC!
* Lukasz D.K. - for huge archive of PS2 stuff
* Guilherme Lampert - for code sources
* Jesper Svennevid, Daniel Collin - for openvcl's code samples
* Whole PS2DEV team
* Manieq - for nice splash screens!
* And so many other guys. Thanks!
