### Description
Tyra is a project that allows you to easily create games for the PlayStation 2 console.  
When I tried to make a game for PS2 a few years ago, I realized how many things had to be done to tame this exotic console architecture.
Decision was simple - I need to create an engine which will handle 3D file loading, 2D/3D rendering, animation, audio,  handling between PS2 CPUs, synchronization.. It should be simple as possible - so people with no experience can create a simple game in a few hours.  
**And that's what Tyra is all about.**

### Features
* Docker image with Tyra, all tools and `PS2DEV` C++20 compiler
* 3D rendering via `VU1` coprocessor:
  * Static rendering  
  * Morph animation rendering  
  * Super optimized, custom minecraft block renderer  
  * Debug rendering (lines, boxes, bboxes)
  * Manual rendering (a'la `OpenGL`)
* 2D rendering
* Frustum culling:
  * Simple - culling whole mesh
  * Precise - culling only visible parts of mesh
* Clipping:
  * Standard "fake", but fast PS2 clipping done in `VU1`
  * Software clipping done in `EE Core`
* Optimized math functions via `VU0` coprocessor   
* Background music and sound effects support 
* Pad support
* USB support
* Memory card support
* `.wav` Audio file support
* `.obj` 3D file support
* `.md2` 3D file support
* `.png` Texture file support

### Branches
* `master` - stable releases - tested on PS2 & PCSX2.  
* `develop` - daily builds.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/h4570/tyra/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Built With  

* [PS2DEV](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev)  
* [VCLPP](https://github.com/glampert/vclpp)  
* Sony VCL

## Acronyms 
* EE (Emotion Engine) - whole set of processors and subsystems that make up the PlayStation 2 
* EE Core - main PS2 CPU (c++ done here) 
* GS (Graphic synthesizer) - configurable rasterizer and texture mapper. Has only 2MB~ memory for textures, but for the opposite have very high transfer rate, so you can switch textures in the blink 
* VU0 - programmable (ASM) vector processor that is accessed by inline assembly code injected into C program.  
* VU1 - programmable (ASM) vector processor, which is similar to vertex shader. Accessed via DMA.  
* IOP - I/O processor which enables access to peripheral devices, such the game controller
